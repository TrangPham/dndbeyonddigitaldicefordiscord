# This is a simple Extension which allows you to send your Digital Dice rolls from your D&D Beyond character sheet to a Discord channel.

## Installation

### Chrome

Head on over to the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/digital-dice-for-discord/oihhmjdpffiifofgmhkjimhnbfhelinm) and click "Add to Chrome"!

### Developer installation:
1. [Download this repo](https://github.com/nick-vanpraet/dndbeyonddigitaldicefordiscord/archive/master.zip) and unzip it
2. Go to chrome://extensions and enable "developer mode" (top right toggle)
3. Click "Load unpacked" in the top left and select the "src" folder inside this repo

## Use

Once the extension has installed, it will add a small dice icon in the top right of your browser. Clicking that will
open the settings page where you can manage your characters.

This page will automatically open after installation as well.

Enter name, character sheet, and Discord webhook for the channel to send your rolls to and hit "Add character".
That's it, ready to roll. You can disconnect your character from Discord by using the toggle, or completely
remove your character from this extension by clicking "Remove".
